When I first attempted this project, I was kind of busy I understood most of the individual working parts but I didn't take the time to complete the project as written up in the directions.  My hypothesis is that students had a similar sensation. These are my notes as I'm attempting to give a student feedback and I'm forcing myself to go through the project and complete it to enough of a degree to hopefully have a picture of how a student might encounter and/or react to this project.

- I've read the readme and configured my env keys, I'm running ``` ./twitter get_timeline "jcdavison"``` and nothing is happening.  More looking at the code makes me think I need to build out the run_app method.

- Attempting to build out run_app method, i would think it was pretty unclear to a student that they needed to create if else logic to run secondary methods etc.  i'm curious if we have feedback about how students did with this? 

- very unclear what the relationship between the oauth headers and the twitter api documentation is, i think it would be relevent to include more discussion that connects how simple oauth works (there is no documentation of simple oauth on their github page) and what twitter is looking for.
